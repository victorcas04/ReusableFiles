# ReusableFiles
Files that can be reused in several UE and C++ projects

**CleanProject.bat**

Double-click to delete all temporal data created by Unreal and visual studio when opening the editor and building.
This does not delete DerivedDataCache by default even if it's autogenerated content cause it would take forever to compile all shaders from scratch again. If you are having problems with shaders you might want to uncomment the line with the "REM" comment, but be aware this will make you remove all shaders saved.

**.gitignore**
Has only a few additional lines that differ from the standard Unreal gitignore for some cases where folders were not being deleted.
